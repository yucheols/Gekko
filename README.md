# Assessing the establishment potentials for the two gecko species introduced to South Korea (Gekko japonicus and G. swinhonis)
MaxEnt ecological niche modeling workflow based on the SDMtune package (Vignali et al. 2020) and niche analyses using the ENMTools package (Warren et al., 2021).

## Study background
- Currently, there are two gecko species known from South Korea: Gekko japonicus and G. swinhonis. Both species are not native to South Korea.
- G. japonicus was known to be present in South Korea from at least 1885. The presence of G. swinhonis is reported in 2021.

## Dataset
- The "Dataset" folder contains all the data necessary to conduct the analyses done in this paper.
- The "bg" subfolder contains the background points for each species that were used for MaxEnt modeling.
- The "envs" subfolder contains the raster layers used for model calibration.
- The "occs" subfolder contains the spatially thinned occurrence points for each species that were used for MaxEnt modeling.
- The "proj_envs" subfolder contains the future climate layers used for model transfer.
